3. **Enterprise monitoring** through Mathom dashboard

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk

- **SEC Edgar MCP**: Official data source, alpha but stable
- **Mathom deployment**: Local development, established architecture

### Medium Risk

- **Octagon Transcripts**: Third-party API dependency, cost implications
- **AWS LangGraph adoption**: Requires cloud infrastructure investment

### High Risk

- **WebWatcher integration**: Research-stage technology, uncertain production readiness

## Cost Implications

### Free Resources

- SEC Edgar MCP (official SEC data)
- Mathom (open source deployment)
- AWS LangGraph patterns (architectural guidance)

### Paid Resources

- Octagon Transcripts (API key required, pricing unknown)
- AWS deployment infrastructure (Bedrock, compute costs)

## Next Steps

1. **Prototype SEC Edgar integration** to establish free data baseline
2. **Deploy Mathom development environment** for MCP testing
3. **Request Octagon Transcripts pricing** for cost-benefit analysis
4. **Design agent architecture** based on AWS LangGraph patterns
5. **Evaluate WebWatcher techniques** for document processing enhancement
