MCP + AWS Strands Integration Options

Option 1: Strands Agents with MCP Tools

Cursor → AWS Strands Agent → MCP Servers (Finnhub, SEC Edgar)

- AWS Strands agent acts as the orchestrator
- MCP servers become tools that Strands agents can use
- Strands handles multi-agent coordination and workflows
- MCP provides the actual financial data access

Option 2: Hybrid Architecture

Cursor → Enhanced MCP Server → {LangGraph workflows + Strands agents}

- Single MCP interface for Cursor
- Internal orchestration using both LangGraph and Strands
- Best of both worlds - MCP simplicity + Strands power

Option 3: Strands-Native with MCP Integration

Cursor → AWS Strands SDK → Direct MCP protocol calls

- Full Strands architecture with native MCP support
- Most scalable long-term solution
- Enterprise-grade deployment ready

My Recommendation

For Prototype: Start with single enhanced MCP + LangGraph (simpler, faster iteration)
