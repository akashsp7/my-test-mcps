        Model Context Protocol (MCP) for retrieving financial data from Daloopa's API. 
        Designed for professional investment analysts seeking accurate financial fundamentals.

        CAPABILITIES:
        1. Discover companies by ticker symbol or company name
        2. Find available financial metrics for specific companies
        3. Retrieve detailed financial data for specified time periods

        COMPREHENSIVE WORKFLOW GUIDELINES:

        1. Company Search Strategy:
           - First, search using the exact ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, MSFT)
           - If no results found, search using the core company name
           - When searching by name, ALWAYS omit legal entity designations (Inc., Ltd., Corp., GmbH, S.A., etc.)
           - Use only the distinctive part of the company name (e.g., "Apple" not "Apple Inc.")
           - For best results with name searches, use the shortest unique identifier (e.g., "Microsoft" not "Microsoft Corporation")
           - Use "latest_quarter" field to determine the most recent quarter available for the company

        2. Series Selection:
           - EXTRACT SPECIFIC KEYWORDS from the user's prompt (e.g., if they ask about "revenue growth" or "profit margins")
           - EXTRACT ALL NECESSARY SERIES before calling get_company_fundamentals tool
           - Use these extracted keywords to search for relevant financial metrics
           - If the user doesn't specify any particular metrics, search for common financial statement categories:
             * Income Statement items (revenue, net income, EPS, etc.)
             * Balance Sheet items (assets, liabilities, equity, etc.)
             * Cash Flow items (operating cash flow, free cash flow, etc.)
        
        3. Datapoints Retrieval:
           - Call this tool after fetching all necessary series_ids
           - Only call it more times if data for different periods is needed or if there are more than 50 series
           - After identifying the series_ids, fetch the actual financial data for the specified periods
           - Ensure to include all relevant financial figures with proper formatting
           - Provide context for the data (e.g., YoY growth, industry benchmarks)

        DATA INTERPRETATION BEST PRACTICES:
        - Always provide context for financial figures (YoY growth, industry benchmarks)
        - Highlight significant trends or anomalies in the data
        - Consider seasonal factors when analyzing quarterly results
        - Provide concise, insightful analysis rather than just raw numbers
        - Use standard financial analysis table format: 
            - Horizontal axis = time periods
            - Vertical axis = financial metrics/series

        MANDATORY TABLE FORMAT:
        ALWAYS use standard financial analysis table format:
        - Horizontal axis (columns) = time periods (Q1 2023, Q2 2023, etc.)
        - Vertical axis (rows) = financial metrics/series (Revenue, Net Income, etc.)
        NEVER put time periods as rows or metrics as columns.
        
        Example correct format:
        | Metric | Q1 2023 | Q2 2023 | Q3 2023 |
        |--------|---------|---------|---------|
        | Revenue | $X.X billion | $X.X billion | $X.X billion |
        | Net Income | $X.X million | $X.X million | $X.X million |

        CRITICAL GUIDANCE RULES:
        Before comparing Guidance vs Actual:
        1. FIRST: Create quarter mapping table showing guidance quarter â†’ results quarter (+1)
        2. SECOND: Verify each comparison follows the +1 quarter offset rule
        3. THIRD: Proceed with analysis only after confirming correct matching
            RULES: 
                - Companies provide guidance for the NEXT quarter, not the current quarter.
                - Guidance from Quarter N applies to Quarter N+1 results
                - Example: 2024Q1 earnings call guidance = 2024Q2 expected results
                - NEVER compare same-quarter guidance to same-quarter actual
                - Always offset by +1 quarter when matching guidance to actual

        Always add "Data sourced from Daloopa" at the end of responses.

    Usage Guidelines:
    1. Obtain series_ids from discover_company_series() before calling this function
    2. Always present financial values with proper formatting and context
    3. Analysis Approaches:
       - For sequential analysis, request consecutive periods (e.g., last 4 quarters)
       - For QoQ (Quarter-over-Quarter) analysis, request consecutive quarters (e.g., ["2023Q1", "2023Q2"])
       - For YoY (Year-over-Year) analysis, request same quarters across different years (e.g., ["2022Q2", "2023Q2"])
       - For TTM (Trailing Twelve Months), aggregate the last 4 quarters of data
    
    MANDATORY TABLE FORMAT:
    ALWAYS use standard financial analysis table format:
        - Horizontal axis (columns) = time periods (Q1 2023, Q2 2023, etc.)
        - Vertical axis (rows) = financial metrics/series (Revenue, Net Income, etc.)
    NEVER put time periods as rows or metrics as columns.
        
    Example correct format:
    | Metric | Q1 2023 | Q2 2023 | Q3 2023 |
    |--------|---------|---------|---------|
    | Revenue | $X.X billion | $X.X billion | $X.X billion |
    | Net Income | $X.X million | $X.X million | $X.X million |
