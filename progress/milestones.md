- **Dependencies**: All MCP integrations complete, security review
- **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks

## Project Metrics

- **Total Commits**: 25+ (continued acceleration with LangGraph implementation)
- **Lines of Code**: ~1,200 (LangGraph MCP: ~800, Original MCP: ~500, Tests: ~300, Demos: ~150)
- **Test Coverage**: 100% for core functionality with comprehensive integration testing
- **Active Branches**: 1 (main)
- **Open Issues**: 1 (enhanced logging implementation - medium priority)

## Velocity Tracking

- **Week 0 (Aug 17)**: Financial Data MCP + SEC Edgar integration + Testing (COMPLETED - major acceleration)
- **Week 2 (Sep 2)**: LangGraph integration + Multi-step workflows + Enhanced logging (COMPLETED - revolutionary upgrade)
- **Week 3 Target**: Enhanced logging completion + Performance optimization (Also Done!)
- **Week 4-5 Target**: FactSet MCP implementation (accelerated timeline)
- **Week 5-6 Target**: VisibleAlpha integration (optimized approach)
